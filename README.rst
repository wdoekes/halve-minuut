halve-minuut
============

*HTML/JS helper for board game with more than 29 minute-fractions.*

This online version is playable on a tablet/phone/laptop and allows the
site owner to create custom dictionaries for specific audiences
(children, programmers, ...).

For a proper game experience, you'll need an original board game with a
special dice and a board to keep the team score.

TODO

* Add i18n.
* Allow for wordlist selection at game-start.
* Don't necessarily load all words at page-load.
* Fix timer location; fix timer beep (volume!).
* Use observer-pattern for UI updates instead of this sloppy code.
